        This proposal was produced in collaboration with members of the W3C
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a>,
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Working Group</a>
        and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/">Touch Events Community Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DOM input events are an abstraction above low-level input events, only loosely
        tied to physical device input (e.g. <code>click</code> events can be fired by a mouse,
        touchscreen or keyboard). There is no mechanism to obtain
        lower-level details about the physical device responsible for an event.
        Depending on implementation, certain types of input can also generate further
        "fake" DOM input events for compatibility reasons. For example, touchscreen interactions
        not only fire touch events, but also compatibility mouse events; when supporting both mouse and
        touch input, it's difficult to know whether a <code>mousedown</code> event represents
        new input from a mouse, or a compatibility event for a previously processed touchstart event.
        This leads to problems, as developers may need to make assumptions or rely on heuristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The InputDeviceCapabilities API is designed to provide additional details about the underlying
        sources of input events.  To avoid reliance on faulty assumptions (which may be
        violated by edge cases or future input devices), this API attempts to describe how
        a device behaves (e.g. whether it fires touch events), not what it is
        (e.g. a touchscreen).  Initially this API is very minimal, focused on solving

      <h2>The <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code> interface</h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>InputDeviceCapabilities</dfn> represents an input device (or group of related devices)
        capable of generating input events.  Events caused by the same physical input device
        will get the same <code>sourceCapabilities</code> object, but the converse isn't necessarily true.
        E.g. two mice with the same capabilities in a system may appear as a single
        <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code> instance.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        In some cases an <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code> will represent the capabilities of a logical
        device rather than a physical input device.  For example, in some environments keyboard events
        are generated by tapping on an on-screen keyboard on a touchscreen.  In such a
        scenario the <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code> represents the capabilities of the virtual keyboard
        (since that's really what matters to authors), not the capabilities of the physical
        touchscreen device (which should be considered an implementation detail of the logical
        keyboard device).
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        [Constructor(optional InputDeviceCapabilitiesInit deviceInitDict)]
        interface InputDeviceCapabilities {
          readonly attribute boolean firesTouchEvents;
          readonly attribute boolean pointerMovementScrolls;
        };

        dictionary InputDeviceCapabilitiesInit {
          boolean firesTouchEvents = false;
          boolean pointerMovementScrolls = false;
        };
      </pre>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>firesTouchEvents</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates whether this device dispatches [[Touch-Events]].
          <div class="note">
            This property can be used to detect mouse events [[UIEvents]] which represent
            an action that may have already been handled by touch event handlers.  See
            <a href="#example_1">Example 1</a> for details.
            This doesn't necessarily mean the device is a touch screen.  For example,
            stylus and mouse devices typically generate touch events on mobile browsers.
          </div>
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>pointerMovementScrolls</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates whether this device is a pointing device which typically triggers
          scrolling when it is dragged across the content.
          <div class="note">
            This property is typically <code>true</code> for direct-manipulation pointing
            devices (those where the physical metaphor is one of the user directly
            manipulating an object on the screen), such as touch screens and some
            on-screen stylus devices common on phones.<br>
            This property can be used, for example, in libraries which attempt to mimic
            native scrolling by consuming low-level input events.  Such libraries typically
            respond to touch events but not mouse events.  [[PointerEvents]] provide
            an abstraction between these devices (including devices like pens which may
            behave in either way depending on system convention).  So when using the
            [[PointerEvents]] API it's best to explicitly check this capability rather
            than make assumptions about which types of events should trigger scrolling behavior.

      <h2>Extensions to the <code>UIEvent</code> interface and <code>UIEventInit</code> dictionary</h2>
      <p><code>UIEvent</code> and <code>UIEventInit</code> are defined in [[!UIEvents]].</p>
      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface UIEvent {
          readonly attribute InputDeviceCapabilities? sourceCapabilities;
        };

        partial dictionary UIEventInit {
          InputDeviceCapabilities? sourceCapabilities = null;
        };

      <dl dfn-for="UIEvent">
        <dt><dfn>sourceCapabilities</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates the <a>InputDeviceCapabilities</a> responsible for the generation
          of this event, or <code>null</code> if no input device was responsible.
            When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of
            different input events, all events in the series should have the same
            <code>sourceCapabilities</code>.
            For example, when a user lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several
            UIEvents may be generated including <code>touchend</code>, <code>mousedown</code>,
            <code>click</code>, and <code>focus</code>.  All of these events must
            have the same <code>sourceCapabilities</code> representing the touchscreen.
          <div class="note">
            A device is considered "responsible" for an event only when that interaction
            is part of the abstraction provided by the web platform.  For example,
            many user agents allow a window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard,
            but this detail is not exposed to the web platform in any way and so the <code>sourceCapabilities</code>
            of a <code>resize</code> event will typically be <code>null</code>.
